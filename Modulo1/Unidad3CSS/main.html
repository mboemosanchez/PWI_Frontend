                    <p>A small kingdom in the land of Hyrule is engulfed by chaos when an army led by Ganon, the prince
                        of darkness, invaded and stole the Triforce of Power, one part of a magical artifact which alone
                        bestows great strength.[10] In an attempt to prevent him from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom,
                        Princess Zelda splits it into eight fragments and hides them in secret underground dungeons.[10]
                        Before eventually being kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone
                        courageous enough to save the kingdom.[10] While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded
                        by Ganon's henchmen, when a young boy named Link appears and rescues her.[10] Upon hearing
                        Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the
                        Triforce of Wisdom, with which Ganon can then be defeated.[10]
                        <br>
                        During the course of the tale, Link locates and braves the eight underworld labyrinths, and
                        beyond their defeated guardian monsters retrieves each fragment. With the completed Triforce of
                        Wisdom, he is able to infiltrate Ganon's hideout in Death Mountain, confronting the prince of
                        darkness and destroying him with the Silver Arrow.[30] Obtaining the Triforce of Power from
                        Ganon's ashes, Link returns it and the restored Triforce of Wisdom to the rescued Princess
                        Zelda, and peace returns to Hyrule.[31]

                    <h3>The Legend of Zelda (1987)</h3>
                    <hr class="solid">
                    <img class="gamePhoto" id="zelda1987"></img>
                    <p>One year after the events of The Legend of Zelda,[6] the now-16-year-old Link notices a strange
                        mark on the back of his left hand, exactly like the crest of Hyrule. He seeks out Impa, who
                        takes him to the North Castle, where a door has been magically sealed for generations. Impa
                        places the back of Link's left hand on the door, and it opens, revealing a sleeping maiden. Impa
                        tells Link that the maiden is Zelda (not the Zelda from the first game), the princess of Hyrule
                        from long ago, and the origin of the titular "Legend of Zelda". Zelda's brother tried to force
                        her into telling their recently deceased father's secrets concerning the Triforce. Princess
                        Zelda refused to reveal its location, and the prince's wizard friend, in anger, tried to strike
                        her down with a spell. Zelda fell under a powerful sleeping spell, but the wizard was unable to
                        control the wildly arcing magic and was killed by it. The prince, filled with remorse and unable
                        to reverse the spell, had his sister placed in the castle tower, hoping she would one day be
                        awakened. He decreed that princesses born to the royal family from that point on would be named
                        Zelda, in remembrance of this tragedy.[5]
                        <br>
                        Impa says that the mark on Link's hand means that he is the hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She
                        gives Link a chest containing six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of
                        Hyrule can read. Link finds that he can read the document, even though he has never seen the
                        language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces
                        scattered across Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce
                        of Courage. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link
                        sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, Ganon's followers seek to kill Link, as
                        sprinkling his blood on Ganon's ashes will bring Ganon back to life.[5]
                        <br>
                        Ultimately, Link restores the crystals to the six palaces and enters the Great Palace. After
                        venturing deep inside, Link battles a flying creature known as Thunderbird, followed by his
                        shadowy doppelgänger Dark Link. Link then claims the Triforce of Courage and returns to Zelda.
                        The three triangles unite into the Triforce, and Link's wish awakens Zelda.[4]

                    <p>The fairy Navi awakens Link from a nightmare in which he witnesses a man in black armor pursuing
                        a young girl on horseback. Navi brings Link to the Great Deku Tree, who is cursed and near
                        death. The Deku Tree tells Link a "wicked man of the desert" cursed him and seeks to conquer the
                        world, and that Link must stop him. Before dying, the Great Deku Tree gives Link the Spiritual
                        Stone of the Forest and sends him to Hyrule Castle to speak with Hyrule's princess.[4]: 6 
                        <br>
                        At the Hyrule Castle garden, Link meets Princess Zelda, who believes Ganondorf, the evil
                        sorcerer Gerudo king, is seeking the Triforce, a holy relic that gives its holder godlike power.
                        Zelda asks Link to obtain the three Spiritual Stones so he can enter the Sacred Realm and claim
                        the Triforce before Ganondorf reaches it.[9] Link collects the other two stones: the first from
                        Darunia, leader of the Gorons, and the second from Ruto, princess of the Zoras. Link returns to
                        Hyrule Castle, where he sees Ganondorf chase Zelda and her caretaker Impa on horseback, like in
                        his nightmare, and unsuccessfully attempts to stop him.[10] Inside the Temple of Time, he uses
                        the Ocarina of Time, a gift from Zelda, and the Spiritual Stones to open the door to the Sacred
                        Realm. There he finds the Master Sword, but as he pulls it from its pedestal, Ganondorf, having
                        snuck into the Temple after Link, appears and claims the Triforce.[11]
                        <br>
                        Seven years later, an older Link awakens in the Sacred Realm and is met by Rauru, one of the
                        seven Sages who protects the entrance to the Sacred Realm. Rauru explains that Link's spirit was
                        sealed for seven years until he was old enough to wield the Master Sword and defeat Ganondorf,
                        the sorcerer king of evil, who has now taken over Hyrule.[12] The seven sages can imprison
                        Ganondorf in the Sacred Realm, but five are unaware of their identities as sages. Link is
                        returned to the Temple of Time, where he meets the mysterious Sheik, who guides him to free five
                        temples from Ganondorf's control and allow each temple's sage to awaken.[13] Link befriended all
                        five sages as a child: his childhood friend Saria, the Sage of the Forest Temple; Darunia, the
                        Sage of the Fire Temple; Ruto, the Sage of the Water Temple; Impa, the Sage of the Shadow
                        Temple; and Nabooru, leader of the Gerudos in Ganondorf's absence, the Sage of the Spirit
                        Temple. After the five sages awaken, Sheik reveals herself to be Zelda in disguise, and the
                        seventh sage. She tells Link that Ganondorf's heart was unbalanced, causing the Triforce to
                        split into three pieces. Ganondorf acquired only the Triforce of Power, while Zelda received the
                        Triforce of Wisdom and Link the Triforce of Courage.[14]
                        <br>
                        Ganondorf appears and kidnaps Zelda, imprisoning her in his castle. The other six sages help
                        Link infiltrate the stronghold; Link frees Zelda after defeating Ganondorf, who destroys the
                        castle in an attempt to kill Link and Zelda. After they escape the collapsing castle, Ganondorf
                        emerges from the rubble and transforms into a boar-like beast named Ganon using the Triforce of
                        Power, knocking the Master Sword from Link's hand; with Zelda's aid, Link retrieves the Master
                        Sword and defeats Ganon. The seven sages seal Ganondorf in the Dark Realm; still holding the
                        Triforce of Power, he vows to take revenge on their descendants.[15] Zelda uses the Ocarina of
                        Time to send Link back to his childhood. Navi departs and young Link meets Zelda in the castle
                        garden once more, where he retains knowledge of Hyrule's fate, starting with Hyrule's
                        decline.[16]

                    <p>Majora's Mask takes place a few months after The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time[21] and begins
                        with Link searching for his departed fairy, Navi. While riding through a forest in Hyrule on his
                        horse Epona, Link is ambushed by a Skull Kid wearing a mysterious mask and his fairy friends
                        Tatl and Tael, who steal both Epona and the Ocarina of Time. Link follows them down a dark cave
                        and confronts the Skull Kid, who taunts him and casts a curse transforming him into a Deku
                        Scrub. Tatl prevents Link from pursuing the Skull Kid as he escapes with Tael, resulting in Tatl
                        being separated from her brother. Having no other choice, Tatl asks Link to find Tael who flew
                        to the Clock Tower of the land of Termina; there, he meets the Happy Mask Salesman, who offers
                        to help Link heal his curse in exchange for retrieving the mysterious mask from the Skull Kid,
                        and tells Link he must also obtain the Ocarina of Time in three days.
                        <br>
                        Link and Tatl enter Clock Town, in the middle of the Carnival of Time, set in three days. From a
                        fairy, they learn that the Skull Kid is waiting at the top of the tower, which is only
                        accessible during the eve of the carnival. As the two interact with the residents of Clock Town,
                        they learn of the havoc that Skull Kid had wrought prior to their arrival. At midnight on the
                        third day, the Clock Tower opens, which Link and Tatl ascend. At the top, they confront Skull
                        Kid, and Tatl implores Skull Kid to return the mask, and Skull Kid use the mask's power to
                        expedite the moon's collision with Termina while Tael hurriedly speaks a riddle to them: "Swamp.
                        Mountain. Ocean. Canyon... hurry, the four who are there... bring them here!" Link manages to
                        retrieve the Ocarina of Time and plays the Song of Time, a song Princess Zelda taught him before
                        he left Hyrule. Link and Tatl are brought back through the first day. Meeting with the Happy
                        Mask Salesman again, Link returns to his human form and seals his Deku curse into a mask which
                        can turn him back into a Deku Scrub at will. The salesman then explains that the mask conceals
                        an evil, apocalyptic power that was used by an ancient tribe in hexing rituals known as Majora.
                        The troubles caused by the mask were so great, the ancient ones sealed the mask to prevent it
                        from being misused. Link starts his quest by first going to Woodfall; on his way, Tatl explains
                        that Skull Kid was lonely and they became friends, and he stole the Majora's Mask from the
                        sleeping salesman. At Woodfall, Link becomes embroiled into a wrongful execution following the
                        Deku princess' kidnapping after the lake got poisoned. Link manages to save the princess and
                        lift the cursed lake and prevent the execution after saving a Giant, a being capable of stopping
                        the moon's fall and learns that Skull Kid laid a curse on all the four regions without
                        explanations.
                        <br>
                        On Snowhead, Link saves the Gorons from being frozen by a cursed winter with the power of the
                        late legendary Darmani the Third. At the Great Bay, Link buries Mikau, a Zora which is the
                        guitarist of the "Indigo Go", the music group for the Carnival. Link fulfills Mikau's last wish
                        to save the Great Bay ocean, and help Lulu the singer to recover her voice she lost after giving
                        birth to seven babies. Successful, they go to Ikana Canyon, where Link saves a family father and
                        an army being cursed to live after being killed in an old war.
                        <br>
                        With all four curses lifted, Link confronts Skull Kid again at the top of the Clock Tower and
                        summons the Four Giants, who halt the moon's descent. Majora's Mask reveals he manipulated the
                        Skull Kid and flies up to possess the moon instead. With Tatl at his side, Link follows Majora's
                        Mask to the inside of the moon; deeper into the moon, Link encounters Majora in its bestial
                        form, and defeats it once and for all, returning the moon to its proper place in the sky.[22]
                        The Four Giants return to their sleep, and it's revealed that they were former friends of Skull
                        Kid; they were sealed to prevent him from using Majora's power. The siblings fairies reunite
                        with the newly liberated Skull Kid while The Happy Mask Salesman takes Majora's Mask, now
                        purified of its evil power. Link then leaves Termina on Epona after saying goodbye to Tatl, now
                        close friends, while the Carnival of Time has started. In the post-credits scene, Link leaves
                        the forest, and a drawing on a tree stump of Link, Tatl, Tael, the Skull Kid, and the Four
                        Giants is shown.[23]

                    <h3>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (2006)</h3>
                    <hr class="solid">
                    <img class="gamePhoto" id="zelda2006"></img>
                    <p>The game begins with a teenage boy named Link, who works as a ranch hand in Ordon Village. One
                        day, Bulblins take away the village's children. Link pursues and encounters a wall of Twilight.
                        A Twilight monster pulls him beyond the wall into the Twilight-shrouded forest, where he is
                        transformed into a wolf and imprisoned. Link is soon freed by a creature named Midna, who offers
                        to help him if he obeys her unconditionally. She guides him to Princess Zelda, who explains that
                        Zant, the Sorcerer/Usurper King of the Twili, invaded Hyrule Castle and forced her to surrender.
                        The kingdom became enveloped in Twilight, turning all its inhabitants besides Link and Zelda
                        into invisible spirits.[12] To save Hyrule, Link, aided by Midna, must first revive the Light
                        Spirits by entering the Twilight-covered regions and recovering the Spirits' light from the
                        Twilight beings that had stolen it. Once revitalized, each Spirit returns Link to his Hylian
                        form and informs Link and Midna of the hidden location of a Fused Shadow, one of the fragments
                        of a powerful relic that will have to be used to match Zant's power to defeat him. During this
                        time, the ghost of a departed swordsman, the Hero's Shade, also appears to provide swordsmanship
                        training he had failed to pass on before his untimely death, as well as information regarding
                        Link's destiny in Hyrule.<br>

                        During his journey, Link also finds Ordon Village's children and assists the monkeys of Faron,
                        the Gorons of Eldin, and the Zoras of Lanayru. After restoring the Light Spirits and obtaining
                        the Fused Shadows, Link and Midna are ambushed by Zant, who takes away the fragments. Midna
                        calls him out for abusing his tribe's magic, but Zant reveals that his power comes from another
                        source, and he uses it to trap Link in his wolf state. Failing to persuade Midna into joining
                        forces with him, Zant attempts to dispose of her by exposing her to the light of Lanayru's light
                        spirit. Bringing a dying Midna to Zelda, Link learns from her that he needs the Master Sword to
                        remove Zant's curse and she proceeds to sacrifice herself to heal Midna, vanishing mysteriously.
                        Moved by Zelda's act of selflessness, Midna starts to care more about Link and the fate of his
                        world.[13]<br>

                        After gaining the Master Sword, Link is cleansed of the curse that kept him in wolf form. Deep
                        within the Gerudo Desert, Link and Midna search for the Mirror of Twilight, the only known
                        gateway between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm, but discover that it is broken.[14] The Sages
                        there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but only managed to shatter it into fragments; only
                        the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy the mirror.[15] They also relate that they
                        once used it to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who attempted to steal the Triforce, to the
                        Twilight Realm after failing to execute him. Link and Midna set out to retrieve the missing
                        shards of the mirror. Once it has been fully restored, the Sages reveal to Link that Midna is
                        actually the true ruler of the Twili, usurped and cursed into her current form by Zant.[16]
                        Confronting Zant, Link and Midna learn that he forged a pact with Ganondorf, who asked for his
                        assistance in subjugating Hyrule. After Link defeats Zant, Midna recovers the Fused Shadows and
                        destroys Zant after learning that only Ganondorf's defeat can release her from her curse.
                        <br>
                        Returning to Hyrule, Link and Midna find Ganondorf in Hyrule Castle, with a lifeless Zelda
                        suspended above him. Ganondorf fights Link by possessing Zelda and then transforming into a
                        gigantic boar-like beast, but Link defeats him, and the power Midna received from Zelda is able
                        to resuscitate her. Ganondorf revives, and Midna teleports Link and Zelda outside the castle so
                        she can hold him off with the Fused Shadows. However, as Hyrule Castle collapses, Ganondorf
                        emerges from it victorious, crushing the Fused Shadow piece that Midna wore on her head, and
                        pursues Link on horseback. Assisted by Zelda and the Light Spirits, Link eventually knocks
                        Ganondorf off his horse and duels him on foot before finishing him off with the Master Sword.
                        With Ganondorf defeated, the Light Spirits revive Midna and restore her to her true form. After
                        bidding farewell to Link and Zelda, Midna returns home and destroys the Mirror of Twilight,
                        ultimately severing the link between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm.[17] As Hyrule Castle is
                        rebuilt, Link leaves Ordon Village, heading to parts unknown.

                    <h3>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild (2017)</h3>

                    <p>Breath of the Wild takes place at the end of the Zelda timeline in the kingdom of Hyrule.[18] In
                        ancient times long before the beginning of the game, the ancient Sheikah race had developed
                        Hyrule into an advanced civilization, protected by four enormous animalistic machines called the
                        Divine Beasts and an army of autonomous weapons called Guardians.[19] When the evil Calamity
                        Ganon appeared and threatened Hyrule, four great warriors were given the title of Champion, and
                        each piloted one of the Divine Beasts to weaken Ganon while the princess with the blood of the
                        goddess and her appointed knight fought and defeated him by sealing him away.[20][21]
                        <br>
                        10,000 years later,[22] the kingdom of Hyrule had since regressed to a medieval state.[23][24]
                        Reading their ancestors' prophecies, the Hylians recognized the signs of Ganon's return and
                        excavated surrounding areas to uncover the Divine Beasts and Guardians.[25] During this time,
                        Princess Zelda trained vigorously to awaken the sealing magic needed to defeat Ganon while
                        trying to maintain her personal research. In the meantime, a knight was appointed to protect
                        her: Link, who was chosen due to his ability to wield the Master Sword, also known as the Sword
                        that Seals the Darkness. The champions of Hyrule's races — Daruk, warrior of the mountainous
                        Goron; Mipha, princess of the aquatic Zora; Revali, archer of the birdlike Rito; and Urbosa,
                        chief of the desert-dwelling Gerudo — assembled to pilot the Divine Beasts (Vah Rudania, Vah
                        Ruta, Vah Medoh, and Vah Naboris, respectively) while the current Zelda and Link battled
                        Ganon.[26] However, Ganon possessed the Guardians and Divine Beasts, turning them against
                        Hyrule. King Rhoam and the Champions were killed, the castle town was destroyed, and Link was
                        gravely wounded while defending the Hyrulean Army's only remaining base, Fort Hateno.[27] Zelda
                        took Link to safety for him to heal, hid the Master Sword in the Lost Woods under protection
                        from the Great Deku Tree, and used her magic to seal herself and Ganon in Hyrule Castle.[28]
                        This cataclysmic tragedy came to be known through the ages as the Great Calamity.
                        <br>
                        100 years after being placed in a healing chamber in the Shrine of Resurrection, an amnesiac
                        Link awakens in a now-ravaged Hyrule. He meets an old man, who reveals himself as the lingering
                        spirit of King Rhoam. Rhoam explains that Ganon, sealed in Hyrule Castle, has grown stronger; he
                        pleads for Link to defeat Ganon before he breaks free and destroys the world.[29]
                        <br>
                        Link travels across Hyrule, returning to locations from his past and regaining his memories.
                        With the help of the Hyrulean races,[c] he boards the four Divine Beasts and purges them of
                        Ganon's monsters, releasing the spirits of Hyrule's former champions and allowing them to pilot
                        the Divine Beasts once again. After obtaining the Master Sword from the Lost Woods, Link enters
                        Hyrule Castle and defeats Ganon with the help of the Divine Beasts and Zelda's Bow of Light.
                        Zelda seals Ganon away, restoring peace and allowing the spirits of King Rhoam and the champions
                        to depart to the afterlife. Sensing their presence, Link and Zelda smile fondly.
                        <br>
                        If players have found all 13 memories in the quest "Captured Memories", they unlock a secret
                        ending in which Zelda realizes that Hyrule must be rebuilt and that she and Link must begin the
                        process by themselves.[30][31] As Link and Zelda survey Hyrule and embark to rebuild their
                        world, the princess confides that she may no longer possess any supernatural power, yet still
                        she has happily come to terms with it.[32]

                    <p>After the events of A Link to the Past, the hero Link travels by ship to other countries to train
                        for further threats. A storm destroys his boat at sea, and he washes ashore on Koholint
                        Island,[19] where he is taken to the house of Tarin by his daughter Marin. She is fascinated by
                        Link and the outside world, and tells Link wishfully that, if she were a seagull, she would
                        leave and travel across the sea.[20] After Link recovers his sword, a mysterious owl tells him
                        that he must wake the Wind Fish, Koholint's guardian, in order to return home. The Wind Fish
                        lies dreaming in a giant egg on top of Mt. Tamaranch, and can only be awakened by the eight
                        Instruments of the Sirens.
                        <br>
                        Link proceeds to explore a series of dungeons in order to recover the eight instruments. During
                        his search for the sixth instrument, Link goes to the Ancient Ruins. There he finds a mural that
                        details the reality of the island: that it is merely a dream world created by the Wind Fish.[21]
                        After this revelation, the owl tells Link that this is only a rumor, and only the Wind Fish
                        knows for certain whether it is true. Throughout Koholint Island, nightmare creatures attempt to
                        obstruct Link's quest for the instruments, as they wish to rule the Wind Fish's dreamworld.
                        <br>
                        After collecting all eight instruments from the eight dungeons across Koholint, Link climbs to
                        the top of Mt. Tamaranch and plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish.[7] This breaks open the egg in
                        which the Wind Fish sleeps; Link enters and confronts the last evil being, a Nightmare that
                        takes the form of Ganon and other enemies from Link's past.[22] Its final transformation is
                        "DethI", a cyclopean, dual-tentacled Shadow.[23][24] After Link defeats DethI, the owl reveals
                        itself to be the Wind Fish's spirit, and the Wind Fish confirms that Koholint is all his dream.
                        When Link plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish again, he and the Wind Fish awaken; Koholint Island
                        and all its inhabitants slowly disappear.[25] Link finds himself lying on his ship's driftwood
                        in the middle of the ocean, with the Wind Fish flying overhead. If the player did not lose any
                        lives during the game, Marin is shown flying after the ending credits finish

                    <p>During the Great Calamity, a small Guardian awakens within Hyrule Castle. It escapes the
                        destruction through a time portal but is followed by a portion of Calamity's Ganon's Malice.
                        Arriving in an alternate timeline before the Calamity began, the Guardian is reactivated by Link
                        and Impa during a battle. They take it to engineers Purah and Robbie for study and learn that it
                        came from a future in which Ganon reawakens and destroys Hyrule. To prevent this, King Rhoam
                        assembles four pilots for the recently-discovered Divine Beasts – Mipha, Daruk, Urbosa, and
                        Revali – and commands them, Link, and Zelda to find the Master Sword in Korok Forest.
                        <br>
                        The Champions encounter the dark prophet Astor, who seeks to revive and control Calamity Ganon,
                        corrupting the Forest, but Link draws the Master Sword and forces him to withdraw. Purah's
                        research reveals the presence of Sheikah transport towers hidden underground, and the Champions
                        reactivate them and use them to lead a preemptive strike on the Yiga Clan's hideout in Gerudo
                        Desert. Learning from the Guardian's records that Calamity Ganon will return on Zelda's
                        seventeenth birthday, King Rhoam sends her to train in hopes of awakening her sealing magic in
                        time and deploys the Divine Beasts to prepare for the Calamity's impending return.
                        <br>
                        Robbie and Purah are captured by Yiga spies while restoring the Guardian's memory, but it
                        escapes with the Sheikah Slate and delivers it to Zelda just as the Calamity arrives. The
                        Champions are ambushed in their Divine Beasts by Calamity Ganon's Blights and King Rhoam
                        seemingly sacrifices himself as Link, Zelda, and Impa escape Hyrule Castle. The Guardian summons
                        Sidon, Yunobo, Riju, and Teba from the original timeline to assist Mipha, Daruk, Urbosa, and
                        Revali, respectively, buying Link enough time to destroy the Blights. With the Champions saved
                        and the Divine Beasts restored, they begin to clear the way to Hyrule Castle. To stop the
                        timeline from changing, Astor kills many of the Yiga Clan and uses their life force to resurrect
                        the four Blights. Link is cornered by the revived Blights, but Zelda finally awakens her sealing
                        magic to save him, forcing Astor to retreat. The remnants of the Yiga Clan defect to Zelda's
                        side, and the group also discovers that King Rhoam survived.
                        <br>
                        After Zelda and King Rhoam reconcile, Purah uses the Sheikah towers to transport all their
                        allies to Hyrule Castle for a full-scale assault against Calamity Ganon. Although the Divine
                        Beasts weaken Ganon's spirit form, Astor arrives with Harbinger Ganon, the small Guardian from
                        the current timeline infected with the Malice from the original timeline. After being defeated
                        by Link, Zelda, and the Champions, Astor is consumed by Harbinger Ganon, who transforms into
                        Calamity Ganon. Calamity Ganon corrupts the little Guardian and turns it against the group,
                        forcing them to destroy it. Upon its defeat, Zelda remembers she activated the little Guardian
                        as a child and named it Terrako, but Rhoam took it away so she would focus on her training.
                        Zelda and her allies confront Calamity Ganon but are unable to damage him until Terrako uses the
                        last of its strength to self-destruct, weakening Calamity Ganon. Now vulnerable, Calamity Ganon
                        is defeated by Link, and Zelda uses her power to permanently seal him away. The future heroes
                        are returned to their timeline while Link, Zelda, and their allies look out at the now peaceful
                        Hyrule. In a secret ending, Purah and Robbie repair Terrako, reuniting Zelda with her friend.

                    <p>Skyward Sword takes place at the beginning of the Zelda continuity:[11][12] according to legend,
                        three ancient Goddesses bestowed a great wish-granting power: the Triforce. The Demon King
                        Demise, a deity who had conquered time itself,[13] laid waste to much of the land seeking to
                        take the Triforce. The Goddess Hylia gathered the survivors and sent them into the sky, allowing
                        her to launch a full-scale offensive against Demise. She was victorious, but the land was
                        severely damaged. Uncounted years later, the outcrop is known as Skyloft, and its people believe
                        the surface below is a myth.[12][Game 1]
                        <br>
                        In the present, knight-in-training Link passes his final exam despite attempted interference by
                        his class rival Groose, who considers himself a romantic rival for Link's childhood friend
                        Zelda. After passing the exam and on a celebratory flight together, Zelda is whisked away below
                        the clouds by a dark tornado. After recovering back on Skyloft, Link is led into the island's
                        statue of Hylia to the Goddess Sword by Fi, the spirit of the sword who resides within it. Link
                        draws the sword, showing himself to be the prophesied hero who will finally destroy Demise.
                        Opening a way through the clouds to the surface, Link is guided by Fi to the Sealed Temple,
                        where he meets an old woman who tells him to track Zelda: this leads Link across the regions of
                        Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano, and the Lanayru Desert. While he catches up with Zelda, he is
                        prevented from returning her to Skyloft by Impa, a young woman guarding and guiding Zelda. Link
                        also encounters Ghirahim, a self-proclaimed Demon Lord working towards freeing Demise. At the
                        Temple of Time in the Lanayru Desert, Link defends Zelda and Impa from Ghirahim, buying the two
                        enough time to depart through a Gate of Time into the past, which Impa destroys as they pass
                        through.
                        <br>
                        Returning to the Sealed Temple, Link is followed by Groose and the two end up on the surface
                        together. Link then has to defeat the Imprisoned, a monstrous form of Demise attempting to reach
                        the Sealed Temple, after the old woman shows him a second, albeit dormant, Gate of Time. With
                        the Imprisoned defeated, Link sets out to strengthen the Goddess Sword by passing trials set by
                        the ancient Goddesses and using their gifts to find Sacred Flames to purify and strengthen the
                        blade so the Time Gate can be awakened. Returning to find the Imprisoned attempting to break
                        free, Link reseals it with help from Groose. Activating the Gate of Time and traveling to the
                        past, he finds Zelda and learns that she is the mortal reincarnation of Hylia; Hylia could not
                        kill Demise and was too weakened from their battle to fend him off again, so she created the
                        Goddess Sword and reincarnated as a mortal to find someone who would fulfill her duty by using
                        the Triforce to wish Demise's destruction, as only mortals can use the artifact. Zelda then
                        seals herself inside a crystal to strengthen Demise's seal, granting her power to the Goddess
                        Sword and upgrading it into the Master Sword.[Game 2]
                        <br>
                        Link locates the Triforce on Skyloft and uses it to destroy Demise. With Demise dead, Zelda is
                        freed, but Ghirahim arrives and kidnaps Zelda: though Demise is dead in the present, Ghirahim
                        intends to use Zelda as a sacrifice to resurrect him in the past.[Game 3] Link pursues Ghirahim
                        into the past and fights through his army. He then defeats Ghirahim, who turns out to be the
                        spirit of Demise's sword but is unable to prevent Zelda from being used to reincarnate Demise's
                        humanoid form. Groose guards Zelda's body while Link challenges Demise: Link triumphs and
                        absorbs Demise's essence into the sword, but not before Demise curses Link and Zelda's
                        bloodlines to be haunted by his reincarnated rage.[c][Game 4] To complete the sword's seal, Link
                        drives it into a pedestal in the Sealed Temple, with Fi accepting eternal slumber as a result.
                        Groose, Link and Zelda return to their time while Impa remains behind and destroys the Gate of
                        Time, as she is a person of that time and must watch over the Master Sword.[Game 5] In the
                        present, the old woman greets them one last time before she dies and vanishes, revealing that
                        she was Impa. The game ends with the surface now freely accessible to the residents of Skyloft,
                        while Zelda decides to remain there to watch over the Triforce; she and Link together establish
                        the kingdom of Hyrule.
